# Data protection concept

This document is intended to provide information on how the users data is handled, stored and processed within Quassel.

## Data Handling

### Collection of Data

- User data is collected through various forms and interactions within the application.
- The types of data collected include personal information (e.g., email, birthdate), study-related data, and questionnaire responses.

### Use of Data

- Collected data is used to facilitate the core functionalities of the application, such as managing user accounts, conducting studies, and analyzing questionnaire responses.
- Data is only used for the purposes explicitly stated at the time of collection and in accordance with user consent.

## Data Storage

### Storage Locations

- User data is stored in a secure database with access controls in place to prevent unauthorized access.
- Backups of the database are performed regularly to ensure data integrity and availability.

### Data Encryption

- Sensitive data, such as passwords, is encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms.
- Data in transit is protected using secure communication protocols (HTTPS).

## Data Processing

### Access Control

- Access to user data is restricted to authorized personnel only.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented to ensure that users can only access data relevant to their role (ASSISTANT, ADMINISTRATOR).

### Data Minimization

- Only the minimum amount of data necessary for the intended purpose is collected and processed.
- Data that is no longer needed is securely deleted in accordance with data retention policies.

### Data Integrity
